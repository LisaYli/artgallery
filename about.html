            <p>Hi, I’m Suyapa, and I’m a mixed media mosaic artist. My journey in mosaic artistry had some very humble
                beginnings, at a beginner mosaic course I attended while living in America. However, I loved the
                experience, and I was hooked!

            </p>

            <p>
                Since then, I have lived and breathed mosaic art, researching techniques and ideas, finding inspiration
                from mosaic artist such as Antonio Gaudi, Niki de Saint Phalle , Isaiah Zagar among others, immersing
                myself in the subject so that I can better express my ideas and vision within the medium.

            </p>
            <p>
                When I create pieces today, I never have a plan, or a predetermined outcome of any kind, I work in an
                Intuitive Style, a continuation of my journey. In this way, creativity can flourish without constraint,
                the project evolves naturally, the spontaneity of an idea shaping the piece as it comes. I love working
                this way, I surrender myself to the process, the feeling, and let the piece unfold as it will.

            </p>
            <p>
                The result is art that truly expresses my story, that encompasses the feelings and thoughts of the
                moment. My art is, in the truest sense, me.
            </p>
            <p>
                The materials used are influential throughout the process, the texture and shape contributing to the
                story being told, and here recycled materials have had a significant impact. The creative process is an
                ever evolving one, from the materials to my own vision, I believe that my journey has still only just
                begun, and through new materials and different themes my work continues to adapt and evolve.
                Always on the move, my art constantly delivers something new.

            </p>
            <p>

                My Process:
                Making something out of nothing, transforming something neglected into something to be admired, these
                are the things I am passionate about. I use a wheeled nipper to hand cut every piece of glass,
                porcelain, tile or other material you see in my work. Each piece is then position carefully hand to
                build the art, section by section. This direct method, every individual element being placed face up
                onto the substrate before grouting, blends with my approach, as I shape the design and feel inch by inch
                to produce the final look.
                Once everything is how I want it, careful cleaning and polishing produces a luster that highlights the
                mosaic at its best.
            </p>
